<P>The term, computer virus, describes a potentially damaging computer 
program that affects, or infects, a computer negatively by altering the way
the computer works without the user's knowledge or permission. Once the
virus is in a computer, it can spread throughout and may damage your files
and operating system.</P>

<P>Computer viruses do not generate by chance. The programmer of a 
virus, known as virus author, intentionally writes a virus program to cause
destruction. Writing a virus program usually requires significant programming
skills. Some virus authors find writing viruses a challenge.</P>

<P>Some viruses are harmless that simply freeze a computer temporaily or
display sounds or messages. The Music Bug virus, for example, instructs
the computer to play a few chords of music. Other viruses corrupt data 
stored on the hard disk of the infected computer.</P>

<P>If you notice any unsual changes in your computer's performance, it
may be infected with a virus.</P>
